      <h2>About me</h2>
      </br>
      <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am a Graduate student at the University of Maryland pursuing my master's in Robotics. I am interested in Computer Vision
      and Machine Learning. My undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering got me interested in making machines that can interact with
      the surroundings. My knowledge in Robotics to this point was gained from small courses and projects. To enchance my knowledge
      in Robotics I started my master's at the University of Maryland.</p>
      </br>
      <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My interest in Computer Vision and Machine Learning grew exponentially after taking the Perception for Autonomous Robots
      and Statistical Pattern Recognition courses and working on a variety of projects. I am looking forward to extend my skill set in these fields and open
      to challenging opportunities in the fields of Computer Vision and Machine Learning.</p>

        <h3>Perception and Robotics Group</h3>
        At University of Maryland, I worked in the Perception and Robotics Group Laboratory where I worked on a project of making
        a virtual environment from a given image of a room. I was also responsible for developing a mechanism for drone that
        can enable it to enter in critical structures.

        <h3>Team Taurus</h3>
        At Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, I was invloved in the gokart team of the college which particapates in national and
        international events that are organized in India. International Series of Karting and National Kart Racing Championship are competitions held in India where
        about 100 - 150 teams participate. In the competition each team is not only supposed to design and manufacture their
        own gokart but also present a business model while abiding to the rules of the competition. At team Taurus, I was
        involved as the head member for Engine and Transmission sub-system.
