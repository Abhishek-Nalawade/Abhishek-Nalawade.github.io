    <div class="ArTag">
      <h3>Check ARtag Detection and 3D cube Imposition</h3>
      This project includes detection of ARtags decoding their orientation and imposing an image
      on the tag. Further the pipeline is extended to place a 3D cube on the tag by estimating
      pose matrix.
    </div>
    <div class="HistogramEqualization">
      <h3>Histogram Equalization</h3>
      The goal of this project is to have an equalized histogram and thus the new pixel intensities are
      computed using the cumulative distribution function(CDF). For a BGR frame the color channels are separated
      and for each channel a CDF is computed which results in a noisy frame but equalized histogram. To adrress
      this problem the histogram equalization is often carried out in the HSV color scheme and only on the V
      channel.
    </div>
    <div class="LaneDetection">
      <h3>Lane Detection with Turn Prediction</h3>
      To detect the lane, the region of interest in the frame in front of the vehicle is extracted. Bird's eye
      view of the lane in front of the vehicle is obtained and is then masked in the HSV color scheme to get the
      lanes in the top view. A column wise histogram is plotted to obtain the columns that contain the possible
      lane candidates. Once the lanes are obtained, a polygon is fitted between the detected the lanes to mark
      the lane. The detected lane is then reimposed on the main frame. The turn is predicted by finding the
      difference of the centers of the lanes at the top and bottom of the detected lame in the bird's eye view.
    </div>
    <div class="DepthEstimation">
      <h3>Multiview Geometry Depth Estimation</h3>
      This project's goal is to compute a disparity and a depth map from two given images. Initially the fundamental
      matrix calculated using RANSAC. The possible rotation matrices and translation vectors are obtained from the
      essential matrix. The final pose matrix is found by triangulating the points and checking whehter the points is
      behind or in front of the camera.

    <div class="PCA">
      <h3>Principal Component Analysis</h3>
      In Principal Component Analysis the data is projected on directions that can best represent the data with minimum
      loss in the information and thus dimensionality reduction is achieved. Inother words, we can say that by reducing
      the number of dimnensions we still try to preserve the trends in the data. This is obtained by minimizing the squared
      error between the data and the projected data which is evaluates to a maximization problem whose solution is otained
      by computing the eigenvector of the covariance matrix of the data.
    </div>
    <div class="MDA">
      <h3>Multiple Discriminant Analysis</h3>
      Just like PCA, MDA is also a dimensionality reduction technique. The major difference between PCA and MDA is that while
      PCA tries to find the direction that can best represent the data, MDA finds a direction that can best possibly separate
      the given data. For example if we have to reduce the dimensionality of images that contain the letters "O" and "Q", PCA
      will try to maintain the data of the ring of the letters whereas MDA will try to distinguish the two letters by finding
      the line in the letter "Q". In MDA, the number of dimensions on which we can project the data can be at the most equal to
      the number of classes minus one.
    </div>
    <div class="BayesClassifier">
      <h3>Bayes Classifier</h3>
      The faces are classified by assuming gaussian distribution of the classes and estimating the maximum likelihood values
      of the parameters for each class which is followed by Bayes Classification. This is achieved by computing the posterior
      probabilites for each class given a test sample.
    </div>
    <div class="kNN">
      <h3>k Nearest Neighbors</h3>
      This is a simple classifier that will classify the data based on the k nearest neighbors to it. the letter "k" is used
      to denote that it can be any integer.
    </div>
    <div class="SVM">
      <h3>Support Vector Machines</h3>
      SVMs are supervised learning models that can be used for bilinear classification. Given a set of training examples,
      each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples
      to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. This method leverages reproducing
      kernel hilbert spaces to solve the problem in giher dimensions where the data can be linearly separated. In this project,
      polynomial and RBF kernels have been used.
    </div>
    <div class="BoostedSVM">
      <h3>Boosted SVM</h3>
      Boosting works on the principle that many weak classifiers when combined can result in a good classifier. While combining
      the classifiers, the next classifiers are only provided with the data that the previous classifiers made an error with.

      <h3>15 Puzzle Problem</h3>
      This is a 15 piece puzzle solver which uses Breadth First Search method to find the soltion to a given state. It also
      provides detailed steps required to take to reach the goal state.
    </div>
    <div class="BFS">
      <h3>Breadth First Search</h3>
      This is a planning method used to find path for a point robot so that it can navigate to the required goal while
      avoiding the obstacles in the area.
    </div>
    <div class="Dijkstra">
      <h3>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h3>
      This is planner will always find the best path (lowest cost path) for the robot to reach the goal state. It has been
      implemented for a rigid robot.
    </div>
    <div class="AstarTurtlebot">
      <h3>Astar Algorithm</h3>
      Astar algorithm is a greedy search algorithm that finds a good path in a very short amount of time but the path found may not
      always be the best path for the robot. For this project differential drive contraints have been used and a ROS package hase been
      developed that enables Turtlebot to navigate in the world while avoiding the obstacles.
    </div>
    <div class="RRTstar">
      <h3>Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT*)</h3>
      This is a random sampling planning method that can provide the shortest possible path when the number of sample nodes approach
      infinity. It is an optimized version of RRT algorithm as it rewires the tree if a newly found node can reduce the cost of reaching
      the other nodes.

      <h3>Human Obstacle Detector</h3>
      This project attempts to implement a Perception module for ACME Robotics using high-quality software engineering
      practices such as the Agile Iterative Process, Object Oriented Programming, Pair Programming and Test Driven
      Development. We attempt to achieve robust human detection using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature
      descriptor combined with a Support Vector Machine Model. The algorithm uses HOG features extracted from the
      input data to detect Humans and surround them with rectangular bounding boxes, the centers of which act as
      the pixel coordinates of the detected humans.

      International Series of Karting and National Kart Racing Championship are competitions held in India where
      about 100 - 150 teams participate. In the competition each team is not only supposed to design and manufacture their
      own gokart but also present a business model while abiding to the rules of the competition. At team Taurus, I was
      involved as the head member for Engine and Transmission sub-system. I was responsible for designing the complete drive
      train for the kart.
