      <h3>Autonomous Robot</h3>
      This is a four wheeled robot that can autonomously retrieve an object by avoiding obstacles in its way. The robot achieves its autonomy with the
      help of a camera, an IMU sensor and an ultra sonic sensor.

      Kernel PCA can capture the trends in the data that cannot be captured by the standard PCA. With the help of kernels the PCA problem is solved
      as if were linear in a higher dimension.

      This project includes detection of ARtags decoding their orientation and imposing an image
      on the tag. Further the pipeline is extended to place a 3D cube on the tag by estimating
      pose matrix.

      Classical edge detection algorithms, including the Canny and Sobel, look for intensity discontinuities
      in an image. The more recent pb (probability of boundary) boundary detection algorithm significantly
      outperforms these classical methods by considering texture and color discontinuities in addition to
      intensity discontinuities.

      <a href="https://github.com/Abhishek-Nalawade/Lane-Detection" target="_blank"><h3>Lane Detection with Turn Prediction</h3></a>
      To detect the lane, the region of interest in the frame in front of the vehicle is extracted. Bird's eye
      view of the lane in front of the vehicle is obtained and is then masked in the HSV color scheme to get the
      lanes in the top view. A column wise histogram is plotted to obtain the columns that contain the possible
      lane candidates. Once the lanes are obtained, a polygon is fitted between the detected the lanes to mark
      the lane. The detected lane is then re-imposed on the main frame. The turn is predicted by finding the
      difference of the centers of the lanes at the top and bottom of the detected lane in the bird's eye view.

      <a href="https://github.com/Abhishek-Nalawade/Multiview-Geometry-Depth-Estimation" target="_blank"><h3>Multiview Geometry Depth Estimation</h3></a>
      This project's goal is to compute a disparity and a depth map from two given images. Initially the fundamental
      matrix calculated using RANSAC. The possible rotation matrices and translation vectors are obtained from the
      essential matrix. The final pose matrix is found by triangulating the points and checking whether the points is
      behind or in front of the camera.

      <a href="https://github.com/Abhishek-Nalawade/Histogram-Equalization" target="_blank"><h3>Histogram Equalization</h3></a>
      The goal of this project is to have an equalized histogram and thus the new pixel intensities are
      computed using the cumulative distribution function (CDF). For a BGR frame the color channels are separated
      and for each channel a CDF is computed which results in a noisy frame but equalized histogram. To address
      this problem the histogram equalization is often carried out in the HSV color scheme and only on the V
      channel.

      <div class="PCA">
        <h3>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h3>
        In Principal Component Analysis the data is projected on directions that can best represent the data with minimum
        loss in the information and thus dimensionality reduction is achieved. In other words, we can say that by reducing
        the number of dimensions we still try to preserve the trends in the data. This is obtained by minimizing the squared
        error between the data and the projected data which is evaluates to a maximization problem whose solution is obtained
        by computing the eigenvector of the covariance matrix of the data.
      </div>
      <div class="MDA">
        <h3>Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA)</h3>
        Just like PCA, MDA is also a dimensionality reduction technique. The major difference between PCA and MDA is that while
        PCA tries to find the direction that can best represent the data, MDA finds a direction that can best possibly separate
        the given data. For example if we have to reduce the dimensionality of images that contain the letters "O" and "Q", PCA
        will try to maintain the data of the ring of the letters whereas MDA will try to distinguish the two letters by finding
        the line in the letter "Q". In MDA, the number of dimensions on which we can project the data can be at the most equal to
        the number of classes minus one.
      </div>
      <div class="BayesClassifier">
        <h3>Bayes Classifier</h3>
        The faces are classified by assuming gaussian distribution of the classes and estimating the maximum likelihood values
        of the parameters for each class which is followed by Bayes Classification. This is achieved by computing the posterior
        probabilities for each class given a test sample.
      </div>
      <div class="kNN">
        <h3>k Nearest Neighbors</h3>
        This is a simple classifier that will classify the data based on the k nearest neighbors to it. The letter "k" is used
        to denote that it can be any integer.
      </div>
      <div class="SVM">
        <h3>Support Vector Machines</h3>
        SVMs are supervised learning models that can be used for bilinear classification. Given a set of training examples,
        each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples
        to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. This project leverages reproducing
        kernel hilbert spaces to solve the problem in higher dimensions where the data can be linearly separated. In this project,
        polynomial and RBF kernels have been used.
      </div>
      <div class="BoostedSVM">
        <h3>Boosted SVM</h3>
        Boosting works on the principle that many weak classifiers when combined can result in a good classifier. While combining
        the classifiers, the next classifiers are only provided with the data that the previous classifiers made an error with.

        In this project SVM has been implemented for the purpose of digit recognition with the help of built-in methods offered by
        the Scikit Learn library. The method handles multiclass classification by default and accuracy is tested by varying the
        hyperparameters of the model for the RBF, Polynomial and the linear kernels.

      <div class="transfer">
        <h3>Transfer Learning</h3>
          The problem of limited resources whether computational or limited availability of data can be tackled with the help of transfer
          learning. In transfer learning, an existing CNN architecture with pre-trained weights on a large dataset is used. The convolutional
          layers are retained and the dense layers of the network are replaced with new layers and untrained weights. This way we only have
          to train the last few added layers for each epoch. In this project, MobileNet has been used with weights trained on imagenet dataset.
